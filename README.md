# Analyzing Crime Patterns in Chicago (2018-2022) with PowerBI

### Problem:
This is an analysis of crime data in Chicago from 2018-2022. The goal was to analyze crime patterns and trends to help the Chicago Police Department understand the crime situation and allocate resources effectively.

#### The project covers:

+ Business questions/problem statement: Focused on analyzing crime occurrences by type, location, arrests, domestic crimes, etc to understand trends.
+ Data sources: 5 data files from 2018-2022 provided by Chicago Police Department with info on crime types, police districts/beats, wards, etc.
+ Data model: Star schema with dimensions like date, location, crime type, etc, and a fact table with metrics like crime counts.
+ Data engineering: Steps were taken to clean, transform and load the raw data into the PowerBI model.
+ Measures: DAX measures created for calculations like total crime, arrests, etc.
+ Visualizations: Various charts, maps, etc to analyze crime by type, location, and time. Also, advanced visuals using AI.
+ Analysis: How the outputs address the business questions around tracking crime events, identifying affected areas, trends over time, etc.

Overall, it's a comprehensive analysis of Chicago crime data using PowerBI to generate insights for the police department.

### Results:
The report provides a comprehensive analysis of Chicago crime data from 2018-2022 to uncover insights and trends to guide the Chicago Police Department's strategies and resource allocation. The star schema data model in PowerBI combines multiple dimensions like date, crime type, location, etc with a fact table containing metrics like crime counts. Extensive data engineering steps like cleaning, transformations, and new calculated columns are implemented before loading and modeling the data. The report generates key visualizations including maps to identify high crime areas, charts to analyze trends by crime type and time, and advanced AI visuals to understand why crimes increase or decrease in different segments. DAX measures are created for critical calculations like total crime and arrest percentage. The outputs effectively address the business questions around tracking daily crime events, understanding affected locations and crime types, comparing historical trends, and providing actionable insights while meeting data privacy requirements. The flexible PowerBI model lays the foundation for scalable and sustainable crime analysis for Chicago, providing a strong analytical capability to the Police Department in fighting crime strategically.
